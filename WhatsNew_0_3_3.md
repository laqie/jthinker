**jThinker 0.3.3, Feb 04 2009**

The major improvements since WhatsNew\_0\_3\_1 are:

  * Node grouping.

  * Automatic un-overlapping of nodes in the diagram.

  * Export to JPG and PNG files.

  * Assumptions are now allowed on all diagrams



Several broken things were fixed:

  * Major rewrite of save/load of files. Now this part seems to be error-prone

  * Conflict resolution diagram allows the lightning-like lines

  * Assumptions are allowed for all kinds of diagrams
