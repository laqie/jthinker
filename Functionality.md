**Current**:
  * very easy to use construction of logic trees that are described in [Dettmer's manual](FurtherReading.md)
  * graphical features, such as
    * node colouring,
    * automatic numbering of nodes
    * un-overlapping of nodes
  * export to JPEG/PNG files
  * grouping of nodes

**Planned**:
  * automatic layout of nodes for production of more concise diagram
  * guided construction of the logic trees
  * [anything you can suggest](http://code.google.com/p/jthinker/issues/list)
