jThinker 0.3.1, Nov 14 2008

Changes from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1

[Issue 1](http://code.google.com/p/jthinker/issues/detail?id=1) (enhancement) "Add instant help feature"

Now there's a "Help" menu in the main menubar of the application
with brief description of jThinker features.

[Issue 2](http://code.google.com/p/jthinker/issues/detail?id=2) (enhancement) "Comments feature"

Node editing dialog is now redesigned and allows not only
to alter node's text, but also to set a custom color and add
a comment (displayed as a node's tooltip)

[Issue 4](http://code.google.com/p/jthinker/issues/detail?id=4) (bugfix & enhancement) "Unable to restore saved file"

Fixed a bug with file save/restore (which is probably specific for
Mac OS), also made cosmetic redesign of "File" menu

[Issue 5](http://code.google.com/p/jthinker/issues/detail?id=5) (enhancement) "Add numbering of statements"

Added an option of automatic numbering of statements, which can be
turned on or off via "Diagram Options" entry in the main menubar.
