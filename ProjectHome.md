jThinker is a free open-source tool for visual construction of logic trees for TOC thinking processes.

No more, no less.

I mean, jThinker is not a general-purpose diagram-making tool, which can be used to draw just anything from a mind map to a software flowchart to a floor plan of your suburban house. There's a plenty of such software already, both free and commercial, so pick one if you need one.

Instead, it is a tool designed specially for TOC practioners. Aim of jThinker's design is to make a tool, which is as simple to use as it is possible. So that when you're visualising your thoughts, you can concentrate on thinking, not on how your boxes are laid out on the page.

I'm sure that in current state of the tool, this aim is not reached yet. So, if you have any ideas on how to make it better or if you've experienced any problems while using it, feel free to [contact me](mailto:ivan.appel@gmail.com) at any time.

And at this website you can (by the way, I drew this chart using jThinker itself):
